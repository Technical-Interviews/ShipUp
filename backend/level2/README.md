# Level 2

+ Carriers will not work on Sundays.
+ Some carriers will work on Saturdays while some others won't.
+ When a carrier isn't working, package deliveries will not happen on that day and the delivery will thus be postponed by 1 day.

Adapt the expected delivery computation to take these new rules into account.
