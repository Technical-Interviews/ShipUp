# Shipup Algorithm Challenge


## Guidelines

The exercise will be given during the interview. It will not be very difficult but nor very guided. We expect the candidate to take initiatives and talk to explain his/her choices.

## Exercise 1: Give Change

Write an application that works out the minimum number of coins that should be returned in change if someone gives too much money to pay for an item.


Good luck!
